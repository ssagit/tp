## Project: NUS Module Planner

NUS Module planner is a brownfield project based on AddressBook - Level 3, a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

### Overview:

NUS Module Planner is a desktop application for managing your study plans at NUS. Users can create their own study plans to map out what modules to take for each semester so as to meet their graduation requirements. The application also highlights the pre-requisites for each module, to ensure that the user does not miss them out in their planning. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
